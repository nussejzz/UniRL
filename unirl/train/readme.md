## What it is

`unirl/train` is the optimizer half of the UniRL training loop. It owns the
trainable model's parameters, optimizer, scheduler, EMA shadow, and structural
injection (LoRA / DiffusionNFT / mirror), and it sequences loss → backward → optimizer step
for one rollout track at a time. The loss math itself belongs to the algorithms
module; this module never computes a loss.

## Why it exists

The split exists because two correctness invariants live on the train side, not in
the loss math, and both silently corrupt training if they slip. Per-block
`fully_shard` alone would leave the root params (embed / final norm / lm_head) as
plain replicated tensors FSDP never reduces — their replicas would drift apart
across ranks and the grad-norm would be wrong — so `fsdp_wrap` claims them into a
root `fully_shard` group by default (`root_wrap`) and fails fast when a multi-rank
run leaves a trainable param outside every group. The uniform wrap also keeps the
optimizer an all-`DTensor` param bag (a mixed `Tensor` + `DTensor` bag forces
`foreach=False` or AdamW's fused kernel raises). Centralizing wrap + step here lets
every algorithm inherit these invariants for free; the loss module legitimately
knows nothing about DTensor sharding or wrap topology.

## How it works

- **`FSDPBackend`** (`backend/fsdp/backend.py`) holds the FSDP2-wrapped module
  (`bundle.<trainable_attr>`, default `transformer`), the optimizer, scheduler, and
  EMA (when configured). Structural injection (`inject_lora` / `inject_nft` /
  `inject_mirror`) happens once at construction, *before* `fsdp_wrap`.
  `optimizer_step` is the single chokepoint: clip → step → schedule → EMA, and it
  **skips the whole step on a non-finite grad norm** (stepping would scale every
  parameter by the bad norm and poison the next rollout).
- **`TrainStack`** (`stack/base.py`) takes one backend + one `StageAlgorithm` and runs
  `train_track`: move the segment onto device → `prepare_segment` (freeze π_old
  once) → `num_updates_per_batch` optimizer steps over disjoint mini-batches, each a
  micro-batch loop of `compute_loss_and_backward`. The mini/micro slicing comes from
  one source — the injected `micro_planner` (`stack/planner/`; `CountPlanner` by
  default, `TokenBudgetPlanner` for token packing) — shared with `prepare_segment`,
  so when an algorithm replays its anchor, it's recomputed at the *exact* geometry
  training uses, which is what pins the on-policy PPO ratio to 1 under bf16's
  batch-shape sensitivity. `AgenticTrainer` uses the same interface after
  concatenating every successful trajectory's generated assistant turns.
- **`UnifiedModelTrainStack`** (`unified_model_stack.py`) drives two algorithms
  (`ar` + `image`) backward-accumulating into one shared optimizer step on one
  shared backbone (HunyuanImage3).

**Extending it:** a new structural injection mode is an `inject_<mode>` alongside
`inject_lora` (`lora.py`) and `inject_nft` / `inject_mirror` (`ema.py`), called
before `fsdp_wrap`, plus a config in `configs.py`; a new optimizer or LR schedule
is a branch in `optim.py` plus fields on `OptimizerConfig` / `LrSchedulerConfig`
in `backend/base.py`; a multi-update-capable algorithm sets
`supports_multi_update = True`, declares `anchor_fields`, and exposes
`recomputes_anchor` when its anchor must follow the planned micro geometry (see
`../algorithms/README.md`).

## Gotchas

- **`num_updates_per_batch > 1` needs `supports_multi_update` *and* must evenly
  divide the per-worker batch** — otherwise the ctor or `_build_mini_batch_slices`
  raises (a ragged mini-batch would silently drop samples and desync grad-accum
  across DP ranks).
- **`optimizer_step` silently *skips* (does not crash) on a non-finite grad norm**
  and zeroes grads — a flat loss curve with a logged warning means grads went
  non-finite.
- **`master_dtype` defaults to `None`, so the optimizer master follows `param_dtype`** —
  a bf16-loaded base then keeps a bf16 LoRA master and the ~1e-6 AdamW steps round
  away (the policy drifts into a degenerate reward-hack). An fp32-loaded model gets an
  fp32 master for free; a bf16 load needs `master_dtype: fp32` set explicitly. The
  ctor never warns.
- **The EP fused-expert layout registry is keyed by `config.model_type`, never by
  parameter-name suffix** (`backend/veomni/ep/experts.py`). HunyuanImage3's fused
  params end in `.experts.down_proj` too, but its `gate_and_up` halves are stored
  swapped relative to Qwen3-MoE's `gate_up`, so a suffix match would silently hand
  one model's packing semantics to another — today that only fails closed because
  HI3's *other* suffix happens not to match. An `ExpertExportLayout` pairs a model
  module's `is_fused_expert_param(name)` and
  `iter_hf_expert_tensors(name, stacked)` operations; register it in
  `_EXPERT_EXPORT_LAYOUTS_BY_MODEL_TYPE` to enable full-weight sync for that family.
  Consumers outside `train/` take the transform from
  `backend.expert_weight_export_transform()` — `distributed/weight_sync/` must not
  import the layout (the core-dependency guard rejects it).
- **Advantages are not computed here** — `train` raises if
  `part.advantages is None`; the trainer must call `compute_advantages` on the
  full shard first.
- **`fsdp_wrap` wraps *nothing* when no block class is discovered** — the warning
  says "root-only wrap" but `_enumerate_block_instances` returns `()`, so the
  shard/cast loops are no-ops and the model trains **unsharded and un-cast**. Pass
  `block_class_names` explicitly in the recipe.
- **`fsdp_wrap` shards the leftover params (embed / final norm / lm_head) into a
  root `fully_shard` group by default** (`root_wrap`, on) — the root group never
  reshards after forward. Set `root_wrap: false` for models whose stages call
  submodules of the wrapped object directly (bagel) or that wrap frozen mixed-dtype
  siblings (hunyuan_image3); a multi-rank run with a trainable param left outside
  every group then fails fast.
- **`defer_grad_sync` needs the last micro-batch of an optimizer step to run a
  backward** — the deferred reduce-scatter only fires inside it. If that micro
  skips backward (an all-empty micro) while earlier ones ran, `TrainStack.train`
  raises instead of silently stepping on never-synced grads (which would also
  leak the stale accumulation into the next step's reduce-scatter).
- **`fsdp_mode: hybrid` makes the HSDP shard group explicit** —
  `hsdp_shard_size` is the number of contiguous ranks that shard parameters;
  the remaining `world_size / hsdp_shard_size` dimension holds replicated
  model copies and synchronizes their gradients. Set it to `devices_per_node`
  for the usual intra-node FSDP + inter-node replication layout (for example,
  world 16 with shard 8 gives a `(2, 8)` mesh). Larger groups such as shard 32
  are supported when the world is a larger divisible multiple. Hybrid fails
  fast when the shard size does not divide the world or leaves only one replica
  group; use `full` for that one-group case.
- **`fsdp_mode: no_shard` trades memory for the all-gather** — a `(world, 1)` mesh
  leaves the full model on every rank, so no parameter bytes cross ranks and only
  gradients are all-reduced (DDP). It pays off where the re-gathered bytes dwarf the
  gradient (LoRA on a frozen base re-gathers the whole backbone *every* micro-batch)
  and the model still fits unsharded — per-rank memory becomes the whole model +
  grads + optimizer state. `reshard_after_forward` is **not** a no-op here: `false`
  keeps every block's unsharded compute copy resident, which is a second full copy of
  the model whenever `param_dtype` upcasts (fp32 compute over a bf16 checkpoint), so
  leave it `true` unless that copy is cheap. `defer_grad_sync: true` then gives one
  all-reduce per optimizer step. VeOmni only supports `full`.

## Profiling → Perfetto

Opt-in `torch.profiler` (`unirl/utils/profiling.py`): one env var writes a gzipped Perfetto
trace to `outputs/profiler/` on rank 0 (no-op otherwise). Training compute only (not rollout).

Both capture **one snapshot of a single train step** (after a short warmup, then off — one
trace, not one per step; training keeps running). They differ in *which slice* they record:

- **`one-update`** — one optimizer update (forward + backward + optimizer) with its cross-GPU
  comm. Skips the anchor forward; small; **for compute/comm overlap**.
- **`train`** — the whole step: anchor forward (recompute old-policy log-probs; for diffusion
  it replays the denoising trajectory, so it's large) + all updates. **For step-time breakdown.**

> The unified-model stack (HI3, AR+image) only supports `train` — it fuses each step into a
> single update, so there is no per-update boundary for `one-update` to wrap (a warning is
> logged and no trace is produced).

```bash
UNIRL_PROFILE=one-update  python -m unirl.train_diffusion --config-name=<recipe> ...
UNIRL_PROFILE=train       python -m unirl.train_diffusion --config-name=<recipe> ...

### Configurable env vars (defaults are fine)

| var | what it does | default |
|-----|--------------|---------|
| `UNIRL_PROFILE` | `one-update` / `train` (unset = off) | off |
| `UNIRL_PROFILE_DIR` | where the trace is written (auto-created) | `outputs/profiler` |
| `UNIRL_PROFILE_RANKS` | which ranks profile: `0`, `all`, or a list like `0,8` | `0` |
| `UNIRL_PROFILE_CUDA` | record GPU kernels; `0` = CPU-only trace | `1` |
| `UNIRL_PROFILE_WARMUP` | skip the first few iterations before recording (avoids the one-time first-iter compile / alloc) — one-update: skip N updates; train: schedule warmup | `2` / `1` |
| `UNIRL_PROFILE_MEMORY` | also record CUDA memory alloc/free (memory-over-time; bigger trace) | off |
