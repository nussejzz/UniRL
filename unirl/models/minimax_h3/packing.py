"""Geometry resolution and packed-row layout for MiniMax-H3 t2va.

MiniMax-H3 runs its transformer over ONE packed 1-D sequence holding every
modality at once. For t2va the row order is::

    [ text (L) | target audio (A) | target video (V) ]

(``fl2va`` inserts keyframe conditioning rows between text and audio; that is
Track B and deliberately not built here, though the vendored builder already
supports it via ``keyframe_anchors``.)

This module is a thin resolver over the vendored builders -- the row geometry,
the float64 rotary clock and the tag values are checkpoint contracts, so they
are USED from ``vendor.packing`` rather than reimplemented. What lives here is
only the mapping from UniRL's ``DiffusionSamplingParams`` to the arguments those
builders want, plus the sigma -> timestep conversion.
