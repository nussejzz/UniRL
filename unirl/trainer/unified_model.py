"""UniRL v2 HunyuanImage3 unified-backbone trainer.

One shared HunyuanImage3 backbone (a single MoE transformer that operates in
``mode="gen_text"`` for AR and ``mode="gen_image"`` for DiT) trained jointly by
two algorithms — ``GRPO`` over the AR ``TextSegment`` and ``FlowGRPO``
over the DiT ``LatentSegment`` — both backward-accumulating into ONE LoRA
adapter with a single optimizer step (see :class:`UnifiedModelTrainStack`).

Two-engine design (mirrors :class:`~unirl.models.pe.pipeline.PEPipeline`'s
two-level fan-out but with the backbone shared). PE composes two in-process
child pipelines (SD3 + Qwen3, two LoRAs); HI3 instead drives TWO standalone
vLLM-Omni engine Remotes that share ONE backbone / ONE LoRA:

- ``ar_rollout`` (modality ``hi3_ar_recaption``, GPUs 0-3): original prompt → ``N``
  think/recaption texts (group-by-prompt → AR GRPO).
- ``dit_rollout`` (modality ``hi3_dit_recaption``, GPUs 4-7): each recaption → ``M``
  images of distinct noise (group-by-recaption → FlowGRPO).

The trainer assembles the lineage itself (pre-forks ``[input, ar_shell,
image_shell]`` then re-roots a flat 1:1 sub-request per engine and fills the
shells, exactly like ``ComposedRolloutEngine.generate``) because the two engines
are independent Remotes, not a composed pipeline. Reward routing then matches
:class:`~unirl.trainer.pe.PETrainer`: score the image Part, credit-assign
the mean image reward up to the AR Part, per-Part GRPO advantages, then ONE
:class:`UnifiedModelTrainStack` step (ar.loss + image.loss → one optimizer step on the
single shared LoRA).

GPU partition: each engine is ONE multi-GPU actor anchored on a distinct worker
via ``pool.create_remote(device_ids=[0])`` / ``[4]`` (NOT plain ``remote()``,
which would bind it to the whole fraction=1.0 scope and collide both engines'
device-env in one process). Each engine clears ``CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`` for its
multi-GPU HI3 modality (see ``engine._HI3_MULTI_GPU_MODALITIES``) and its stage
YAML's ``runtime.devices`` pins AR→0-3 / DiT→4-7 — disjoint physical cards. The
boot-smoke anchor was unsafe only because nothing time-shared the cards; here
the colocate dance (base offloaded during rollout, engines asleep during train)
makes anchoring correct — see ``train_step`` and ``_wire_engine``.

One ``train_step``::

    wake ar+dit; [sync → both]; sample = run_rollout(sample)  # → [input, ar, image]
    sleep ar+dit
    reward.score_and_attach(sample)              # only the frontier image Part is scorable
    sample.propagate_rewards("mean")             # image reward → ar Part
    part.compute_advantages() per Part           # ar groups by prompt, image by recaption
    unified_model_stack.train_track(sample)      # tree-shard lineage → 2 backward → 1 step

Pairs with ``examples/unified_model/hi3_vllmomni.yaml`` and ``unirl/train_unified_model.py``.
Deferred (same as the reference trainers): multi-epoch replay, checkpoint /
eval cadence, structured logging.

    The anchored single-actor engines return each track as ONE transport handle
    (a single ref spanning all samples), but the train side is num_devices-way DP and
    slices each track into per-rank shards — a single ref can't be intra-handle
    sliced. Hydrating on the driver fixes the mismatch (the DP dispatch then
    re-shards real tensors), but the driver has no ``TensorTransportRuntime``
    installed, so the runtime-backed ``TensorTransport.hydrate`` is
    unavailable here. ``hydrate`` instead pulls each leaf through
    its ref's ``.materialize(backend=None)`` (a plain ``ray.get`` from the owning worker's store),
    which works from the driver — we walk the nested Batch/dict/list/TUPLE
    structure and apply it to every ``TensorRef``.

    NB: this walks TUPLES too (rebuilding them), unlike ``_collect_leaves``
    which skips them. HunyuanImage3's fused condition stores ``rope_cache`` as a
    ``tuple`` of two TensorRef; the DP scatter's driver-side
    ``Part.concat`` pads that rope (``conditions.concat`` → ``_pad_seq``
    → ``t.ndim``), so the rope MUST be real tensors here. (dp=1 never concats on
    the driver, so it never tripped on this.)

        If a future change makes replay consume ``fused.rope_cache``, dp>1 would

        Mirrors :meth:`train_step`'s rollout+reward path but skips
        credit-assign/advantage/backward: run the ``P→P*N→P*N*M`` fan-out through
        :meth:`run_rollout` (works on both the single-engine trainside and the
        two-engine HI3 path) at the deterministic best-quality setting (CFG at
        ``eval_cfg_text_scale``, ``eta=eval_eta``) and score ONLY the image
        track — the training reward plus the ``eval_rewards`` suites (see
        :mod:`unirl.trainer.eval_suites`). Logs one ``eval/*`` row; returns
        ``eval/reward``.

        The two-engine path syncs the live adapter into the engines once per
        eval (EXTRACT with the base onloaded → wake → PUSH → sleep, mirroring
        :meth:`train_step`'s ordering) — train_step syncs BEFORE its generate,
        so without this the engines would eval one update stale, and a
        restored-checkpoint baseline eval would see fresh engine weights.
        Pushed weights persist across sleep/wake cycles (as train_step relies
        on), so the passes below just wake/sleep around each chunk's rollout.
        Unlike train_step, eval never onloads the base after the extract: there
        is no backward, so the FSDP state stays offloaded (the steady state)
        throughout. The single-engine trainside path needs none of it (the
        rollout shares the live FSDP modules; ``_enable_fsdp_offload`` is
        forced False).
