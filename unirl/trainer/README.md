## What it is

`unirl/trainer/` holds the driver-side trainers for diffusion, autoregressive,
supervised fine-tuning, prompt-enhancement, unified-model, ReFL, asynchronous,
and agentic runs. They
subclass `BaseTrainer` directly or through a domain trainer. A trainer places the
rollout and train workers on GPUs, builds the rollout engine / reward service /
train stack(s) / weight-sync handler, and runs the optimizer loop over them. It
owns **placement and sequencing** — and nothing else: the loss math is
`../algorithms`, the optimizer is `../train`, sampling is `../rollout`, and
scoring is `../reward`.

## Why it exists

Every other module is deliberately blind to the rest — `rollout` doesn't know
`reward`, an algorithm doesn't know which engine sampled. Something has to wire them
into one loop and decide *where each runs*. That is the trainer. Keeping the wiring
in one per-domain class is what lets the loop body stay ~10 lines and every module
stay swappable by `_target_`.

## How it works

- **`BaseTrainer`** (`base.py`) owns the `DevicePool` (built from the top-level cfg:
  `num_devices` / `transport_kind` + the optional TransferQueue bootstrap) and the
  optional rank-0 wandb logger. Subclasses get the configured pool for free.
- **Build phase** (`__init__`). The trainer builds the remote graph in a
  `placement(...)` scope, threading **one shared bundle** into both consumers —
  `bundle → pipeline(bundle) → backend(bundle) → reward → algorithm → stack` — then
  the rollout engine. This shared-bundle injection is the [models contract](../models/README.md):
  replay reads the exact weights training updates. Layout decides the topology:
  `colocate` builds train + rollout as siblings on one slab; `separate` opens two
  disjoint `placement` slabs and runs a one-time cross-slab handshake for weight sync.
- **The Sample-native loop** (`train_step`) is the conductor sequence, one
  rollout per call: `wake_up` → (sync weights, if due) →
  `rollout.generate(sample)` → `reward.score_and_attach(sample)` →
  `part.compute_advantages(...)` → drop reward-only decoded media →
  `stack.train_track(...)`. The driver builds a request `Sample` whose Parts
  preserve prompt lineage and carry sampling parameters. A single-stage stack
  receives the trainable frontier `Part`; `UnifiedModelTrainStack` receives the
  whole `Sample` so AR and image Parts are sharded by the same prompt trees.
  `AgenticTrainer` uses a manager to collect `List[Sample]` groups of
  variable-depth trajectories, scores valid terminal answers, assigns each
  trajectory's advantage to all generated turns, and concatenates those turn
  Parts for training. (ReFL — which differentiates
  directly through decoded media and uses no rollout Samples or advantages —
  lives outside core as `experimental/refl`.)
- **Diffusion residency is one choice per role, not per phase.** `train_resident`,
  `rollout_resident` and `reward_resident` each say whether that role keeps its
  weights on the GPU while it is idle; only weights move, never a role's process.
  Synchronous defaults (`true`/`false`/`true`) reproduce the historical behaviour.
  Async defaults (`true`/`true`/`true`) keep its dedicated rollout slab resident;
  direct `AsyncDiffusionTrainer` construction and the async entry point use the
  same policy. `ResidencyPlanner`
  turns a phase's needs into transitions and issues only the ones that change
  something, so a reward phase inherits an already-parked trainer instead of
  re-offloading it, and the trainer returns once per optimizer step rather than
  once per rollout. Roles that do not share the slab — a reward behind
  `reward_fraction`, or the trainer behind `layout: separate` or a trainside
  rollout — are not tracked, so nothing moves memory the active role could not
  use — and asking to park one of them is rejected rather than ignored. The
  startup rejections are: `train_resident=false` where there is nothing to park
  (`layout: separate`, or a trainside rollout, whose generation reads the very
  weights that would go), with a full-weight sync whose single `sync()` reads the
  trainer and loads the rollout in one call, or with EMA/DiffusionNFT plus an
  external colocated rollout (unvalidated against `backend.ema` state); and under
  `AsyncDiffusionTrainer`, `reward_resident=false` (async scoring runs outside
  `_reward_phase()`) and `rollout_resident=false` (the engine owns a dedicated slab
  and is never idle, so parking it at an evaluation or checkpoint boundary would
  sleep an engine the loop is about to use).

  Both the optimizer step and checkpointing consume the trainer, so it is made
  resident before each; the checkpoint one sits behind
  `maybe_save_checkpoint`'s own due-or-not predicate, so a window that evaluates
  without saving keeps the trainer parked. A LoRA sync holds its extracted adapter
  past the push and until the next optimizer step, so an accumulate window and an
  eval's later chunks reuse it instead of onloading the trainer to read weights
  that cannot have changed. A no-sync eval preserves an unpinned rollout while
  scoring between chunks because sleeping engines such as SGLang would discard
  the adapter that the caller deliberately did not repush. A pinned rollout
  (`rollout_resident: true`) is not
  slept even when generation raises: the policy says its weights stay put, and the
  caller that set it owns the peak.

The current trainer surface is:

| Trainer | Training shape | What's distinctive |
|---|---|---|
| `DiffusionTrainer` | one diffusion `Part` → one `TrainStack` | Reference diffusion loop; supports trainside or dedicated rollout, optional separate reward GPUs, FSDP offload, and DiffusionNFT's EMA-adapter rollout. |
| `ARTrainer` | one AR `Part` → one `TrainStack` | Text or multimodal AR rollout with group/global advantage normalization and optional token-balanced DP shards. |
| `SFTTrainer` | dataset records → one standalone training `Part` | Reuses the RL TrainStack without rollout, reward, or advantages; owns exact epoch/cursor resume and full-set evaluation. |
| `AsyncARTrainer` | FIFO AR generation batch → one `TrainStack` | Separate train/rollout slabs with resident generation and optimizer-update versioning. The trainer refills immediately after collection so the manager's existing dispatch thread overlaps the next generation with scoring and training, then quiesces before weight sync, eval, or checkpoint. |
| `AsyncDiffusionTrainer` | FIFO diffusion generation batch → one `TrainStack` | The same update-versioned manager loop for DiT. Requires `max_inflight=1` and resolves and scores each intact batch before launching its replacement, so cross-slab transfer never queues behind fresh generation. |
| `PETrainer` | `ar` + `diffusion` Parts → two `TrainStack`s | Composed prompt-rewrite/image rollout; image rewards propagate to AR rewrites. `freeze_llm=true` trains and checkpoints diffusion only. |
| `UnifiedModelTrainer` | whole `Sample` → one `UnifiedModelTrainStack` | AR and image losses accumulate into shared-backbone optimizer steps while prompt-tree lineage remains intact during DP scatter. |
| `AgenticTrainer` | variable-depth `List[Sample]` → concatenated turn `Part` | Colocated barrier multi-turn tool use. It syncs every step, waits for complete groups, scores terminal answers through `RewardService`, and excludes failed trajectories. |

All async variants use the driver-local `RolloutManager`. Batch trainers provide
one slab-wide launcher and keep completed batches intact; the agentic trainer
provides one launcher per engine slot and lets the manager assemble root groups.
`weight_sync_interval` counts consumed rollout batches between publications;
`stack.num_updates_per_batch` counts optimizer updates within each batch. They
are independent; `(weight_sync_interval - 1) * num_updates_per_batch` is the
maximum accepted update-version lag.
Async batch trainers own optimizer progress, publication cadence, hard boundaries,
scoring order, and training policy directly. The manager owns published rollout
state and applies its configured filter against the trainer-supplied current
version. The barrier-only `AgenticTrainer` does not expose tail, staleness, or
cross-step buffering policies.

**Extending it:** a new domain is a new `<Domain>Trainer(BaseTrainer)` that builds its
remotes inside a `placement(...)` scope and implements `train_step` + `train`; the
matching `../train_<domain>.py` entrypoint composes the recipe and calls it.

## Checkpointing

Available for the single-backend trainers (including diffusion, AR, unified-model,
ReFL, async, and agentic training) and for every trained side of `PETrainer`. A
single-backend checkpoint bundles model state (`save_mode=auto`: LoRA-only when
LoRA is active, otherwise full; `save_mode=full`: the whole model state;
`save_mode=adapter`: LoRA keys only), optimizer and scheduler state, the step
counters (`step`, `optimizer_step_count`), and the LoRA config (rank / alpha /
target_modules / exclude_modules — export tooling reads its scaling and module
selection from it).

The default backend `checkpoint_format=torch` gathers full state to distributed
rank 0 and writes `<save_dir>/checkpoint-<step>/checkpoint.pt`. Setting the
relevant backend's `fsdp_cfg.checkpoint_format=dcp` writes reshardable DCP
shards plus `metadata.pt` under the checkpoint directory; each rank reads and
writes its own shard. For example, PE configures the AR and diffusion backends
independently, while ReFL uses `policy.fsdp_cfg`. Load auto-detects either
on-disk format.

With `checkpoint_format=dcp`, `checkpoint_async=true` stages the snapshot and
flushes shards in the background. The next save/load drains the prior future,
and every trainer drains the final save before worker teardown.

PE checkpoints use one checkpoint directory per trained side:
`<save_dir>/checkpoint-<step>/diffusion/` and, unless `freeze_llm=true`,
`<save_dir>/checkpoint-<step>/ar/`. Each side uses its backend's selected format.
The driver-owned `trainer_state.json` remains at the common
`checkpoint-<step>/` level. A normal PE save writes every trained side at the
same rollout step; resume expects those sibling directories together.

Save and load are collectives. In the default torch format every rank
participates in gather/broadcast and distributed rank 0 writes the file; in DCP
format every rank writes and reads its shard.

Agentic checkpoints are written only at an idle rollout barrier. Resume restores
the trainable model, optimizer, scheduler, and counters; the next step starts a
fresh complete rollout batch after synchronizing the restored weights.

**Multi-node**: `save_dir` / `load_dir` must live on storage mounted on every
node — the same contract the recipes already place on `PRETRAINED_MODEL` and
data paths. A rank that cannot see the checkpoint fails fast on every rank at
load (instead of stranding the others in the broadcast until the NCCL timeout).

**Meta-init caveat**: full checkpoints in the default torch format reject
never-materialized parameters. Use `checkpoint_format=dcp` for meta-init bundles
such as HI3 80B; DCP requires trainable parameters to be materialized but may
drop frozen auxiliary parameters that remain on meta.

Driven by top-level config keys, read by the entrypoints and forwarded to
`train(...)`:

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `save_interval` | `0` | Save every N rollouts (and on the last); `0` disables saving. |
| `save_dir` | `./checkpoints` | Output folder for `checkpoint-<step>/`, resolved on the driver (with Hydra's legacy chdir the default lands in the run output dir). |
| `save_mode` | `auto` (`adapter` for ReFL; `full` for Async AR) | `auto` = LoRA-only when LoRA is active, otherwise full; `full` = whole model state; `adapter` = LoRA keys only (the frozen base reloads from the pretrained snapshot on resume). |
| `load_dir` | unset | A checkpoint dir to restore and resume from; unset trains fresh. |

Recipes may expose these keys already. When a recipe does not, append them with
Hydra's `+` syntax.
The whole lifecycle — train with saves, resume, fold the LoRA into the base and
export to Hugging Face, share:

```bash
# 1. Train, saving LoRA-only checkpoints every 200 rollouts
bash examples/run_experiment_single_node.sh diffusion/sd3/sd3_trainside \
    num_rollouts=500 \
    +save_interval=200 +save_dir=/ckpts/sd3_run +save_mode=adapter

# 2. Resume (after a preemption, or to extend the budget). num_rollouts is the
#    TOTAL budget (here: rollouts 400..999); the same save_dir is fine —
#    checkpoint numbering continues, and the wandb run reattaches.
bash examples/run_experiment_single_node.sh diffusion/sd3/sd3_trainside \
    num_rollouts=1000 \
    +load_dir=/ckpts/sd3_run/checkpoint-400 \
    +save_interval=200 +save_dir=/ckpts/sd3_run +save_mode=adapter

# 3a. Export a merged model: fold the LoRA into the base weights (scaling from
#     the checkpoint's recorded lora_config) and write a standard save_pretrained folder
python -m unirl.tools.export_full \
    --checkpoint /ckpts/sd3_run/checkpoint-1000 \
    --base stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3.5-medium --subfolder transformer \
    --output /ckpts/sd3_run/hf-1000

# 3b. Or export a PEFT adapter artifact (adapter_model.safetensors +
#     adapter_config.json) for LoRA-aware loaders
python -m unirl.tools.export_adapter \
    --checkpoint /ckpts/sd3_run/checkpoint-1000 \
    --base stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3.5-medium \
    --output /ckpts/sd3_run/adapter-1000

# 4. Share / use the merged model or adapter folder
hf upload <user>/<repo> /ckpts/sd3_run/hf-1000
#   transformer = AutoModel.from_pretrained("<user>/<repo>", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
#   pipe = StableDiffusion3Pipeline.from_pretrained(base, transformer=transformer)
```

`load_dir` restores model/optimizer/scheduler (plus the optimizer-step counter,
so EMA decay schedules continue) and resumes the loop from the saved step.
Synchronous Sample-based trainers continue `training_progress` and
driver-authored x_T scheduling, fast-forward a deterministically seeded data
stream, and force the restored weights into a freshly started rollout engine
when needed. Async AR/diffusion resume reads the backend optimizer count as the
train version, fast-forwards the deterministic input stream to the saved
rollout step, and syncs those restored weights into the fresh engine.
`AgenticTrainer` uses the same backend optimizer count for its next published
rollout version and fast-forwards one input batch per completed step. ReFL does
not currently fast-forward its data source.

The W&B run also continues: driver-written `trainer_state.json` at the
checkpoint root carries the run id and `train/` step axis. For PE this file is
in the common parent above the `ar/` and `diffusion/` side checkpoints.

### Export to Hugging Face format

The checkpoint directory is a raw training artifact (PEFT-injected names and
optimizer state), not a release artifact. The offline checkpoint toolset lives in
`unirl/tools/` (the runtime counterpart for engine weight sync is
`unirl/utils/peft_merge.py`): `export_full` folds the LoRA delta into the base
weights and writes a standard `save_pretrained` folder; `export_adapter`
extracts a single adapter into a PEFT adapter folder.

Works with both checkpoint flavors: `save_mode=full` merges self-contained;
`save_mode=adapter` folds the LoRA keys onto the freshly loaded base weights.
The LoRA scaling comes from the `lora_config` recorded in the checkpoint;
`--lora-alpha` overrides it (needed only for checkpoints predating the record).
AR models: `--library transformers`, no `--subfolder`. For adapter artifacts,
use `python -m unirl.tools.export_adapter --checkpoint ... --base ... --output ...`.
NFT runs can export the EMA shadow adapter with `--adapter old`.

For PE, point the exporter at one side's directory, for example
`checkpoint-1000/diffusion` or `checkpoint-1000/ar`, rather than at the common
parent directory. The exporters auto-detect both the legacy torch-format
`checkpoint.pt` and complete DCP checkpoints (`.metadata` plus `metadata.pt`);
an incomplete asynchronous DCP directory is rejected rather than partially
exported.

## Multiple optimizer updates per rollout

`TrainStack` and `UnifiedModelTrainStack` implement
`stack.num_updates_per_batch`. A value of `N` partitions each worker's rollout
shard into `N` **disjoint** mini-batches and runs one optimizer step per
mini-batch; it is not `N` epochs over the full rollout batch. The pre-update
policy anchor is prepared once and remains frozen across all `N` steps, so
later updates can use the algorithm's ratio/clip trust region against the same
rollout policy.

The stack rejects `N > 1` unless every participating algorithm declares
`supports_multi_update`. The per-worker batch must also divide evenly into `N`
updates. The unified stack slices corresponding AR and image mini-updates and
applies each pair in one shared optimizer step. Multi-update results retain
per-update metrics for logging as well as a rollout-level aggregate.

## Evaluation cadence

`eval_interval=0` disables evaluation. Trainers with evaluation support run a
baseline before training, then evaluate after every `eval_interval` completed
rollouts. Image, PE, unified, and ReFL trainers label a resumed baseline with
the restored step; AR and Async AR currently log that baseline at step 0. When
an evaluation and checkpoint fall on the same step, evaluation runs first.

- `ARTrainer` evaluates the requested prompt set in bounded batches and reports
  mean reward, also exposed as avg@k accuracy for binary evaluators.
  `AsyncARTrainer` quiesces its resident engine first.
- `DiffusionTrainer`, `PETrainer`, and `UnifiedModelTrainer` report image
  reward; optional `eval_rewards` suites can
  score the same generated samples or their own prompt sets. PE scores only the
  diffusion/image frontier. `AsyncDiffusionTrainer` reaches an empty hard
  boundary, syncs the current train version when needed, and then scores
  the resident rollout engine without offloading it afterwards.
- `AgenticTrainer` does not implement evaluation.

### Decoupling diffusion eval from the RL rollout

`DiffusionTrainer` (sync and async) evaluates with the training `sampling:`
block plus, in override order: `eval_eta` (default `0.0` — deterministic ODE;
`<= 0` also clears the SDE gate, `> 0` keeps the training gate and rejects a
step-count override), `eval_samples_per_prompt`, then the optional
`eval_sampling:` overlay, which accepts any plain `DiffusionSamplingParams`
field (object-valued fields such as `scheduler` / `sde_strategy` are rejected)
and inherits `sampling:` for every field it does not mention:

```yaml
sampling:                 # the RL rollout: cheap, stochastic
  num_inference_steps: 10
  guidance_scale: 1.0
  height: 512
  width: 512
  eta: 0.7
  samples_per_prompt: 8

eval_interval: 20
eval_samples_per_prompt: 1
eval_sampling:            # eval only; unset fields inherit `sampling`
  num_inference_steps: 28
  height: 1024
  width: 1024
logging:
  log_media: true         # also uploads the eval panel (below)
```

CFG has no eval knob of its own: leave `guidance_scale` unmentioned and eval
runs at the training guidance (a CFG-off run cannot silently evaluate with CFG
on); name it in `eval_sampling:` to decouple the two. BAGEL-family params
consume `cfg_text_scale`, and passing the inert `guidance_scale` there raises.
Unknown overlay fields raise, and the retired per-field knobs
(`eval_cfg_text_scale`, `eval_num_inference_steps`, ...) fail fast with a
migration hint. Dynamic-shift models re-derive μ from the eval
steps/resolution, so a decoupled eval stays on the model's official schedule;
there is no per-eval time-shift override.

With `logging.log_media: true`, each eval also uploads up to `media_max_items`
generations to `eval/generated_media` (`eval/<suite>/generated_media` for
own-set suites) on the `eval/step` axis, captioned with prompt and reward. The
eval set is served in a fixed order and eval x_T is keyed on prompt content, so
at the default `eval_eta: 0` every eval renders the same prompts from the same
noise — a like-for-like filmstrip in which only the policy differs. An SDE eval
(`eval_eta > 0`) draws per-step noise seeded from the eval step, so its panels
vary by noise too; the trainer warns at startup then, as it does for pipelines
without driver-authored x_T. `media_log_interval` does not apply
(`eval_interval` already paces the panel).

## Gotchas

- **Multi-update means disjoint optimizer mini-batches, not repeated full-batch
  epochs.** See [Multiple optimizer updates per rollout](#multiple-optimizer-updates-per-rollout)
  for the algorithm and divisibility constraints.
- **Agentic evaluation remains deferred.** `AgenticTrainer` has no evaluation
  phase; its recipe configures training only.
- **`layout` only branches on `"separate"`** (`"colocate"` == `"colocated"`). The
  trainside direct-sampling engine cannot live on a `separate` slab — `_build_rollout`
  raises (it needs the pipeline as a local sibling).
- **`weight_sync` is built only when a `sync:` block is present** (dedicated engines);
  trainside sampling reads the live training weights and needs none (`self.weight_sync` stays `None`).
- **FSDP offload during `generate` is off by default** and force-gated off for trainside
  (it reuses the train model) and for DiffusionNFT (its EMA swap touches the backend around `generate`).
- **The bundle must be shared, not rebuilt** — the trainer injects one bundle into both
  pipeline and backend; a second `from_config` would silently desync replay. See [`../models/README.md`](../models/README.md).
