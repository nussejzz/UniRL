"""Trainside (in-process) rollout engine adapter.

Wraps a materialized ``models`` :class:`Pipeline` plus the trainable
stage, and exposes them as a :class:`BaseRolloutEngine`.  Used in
direct-sampling mode where the training model IS the sampler (on-policy
RL) and rollout runs in the same Python process as training — so no
worker subprocess and no weight sync are needed.

        pipeline: A materialized ``models`` pipeline whose

        stage: Optional pre-resolved trainable stage whose
            ``trainable_module()`` is the FSDP-wrapped model (the v1 train
            actor passes one). Takes precedence over ``stage_attrs``.
        stage_attrs: Stage attribute(s) to read off ``pipeline`` and
            eval-scope around ``generate``. A list so composed pipelines can
            drive more than one trainable module (e.g. PE's
            ``["diffusion", "ar"]``); defaults to ``("diffusion",)`` for the
            common single-diffusion engine.
        forward_batch_size: Optional intra-call chunk size for the
            ``pipeline.generate`` forward path. When set and the gen frontier
            exceeds this, ``generate`` slices the frontier Part via
            :meth:`Part.slice`, runs ``pipeline.generate`` per chunk, and
            concatenates the filled gen parts via :meth:`Part.concat`. Bounds
            stage peak memory (e.g. SD3 VAE decode) when there is no external
            inference runtime to chunk for us. **Single gen Part only** — chunking
            a multi-stage lineage would re-run the interior stage(s) per chunk and
            drop their output; ``generate`` rejects that combination.
