"""AgenticRolloutEngine — multi-turn (agentic) rollout over a rank-0 coordinator (LIN-522, LIN-531).

The engine is a ``BaseRolloutEngine`` on a DP-replicated slab. Each worker builds its **own local**
inner single-turn engine + environment (the ``ComposedRolloutEngine`` build-inner pattern) and runs
a **pool of drain threads** (``per_worker_concurrency`` of them) that pull single-trajectory tasks
from a central queue and run each as a plain synchronous multi-turn agent loop on its own thread:
per-turn ``inner.generate`` (the inner engine is safe for concurrent callers — its backend keeps
the in-flight requests batching together) and ``env.step`` (the env is re-entrant across threads).

**Partial rollout interface (LIN-531).** The engine is the *mechanism*; the trainer owns the *policy*
(how many to over-sample, staleness, when to sync). The coordinator exposes a
**submit / poll / finalize / abort** interface over a **background** drain the trainer reaps and interrupts:

- ``submit(request)`` — enqueue a pool (fresh prompts and/or carried partials) and fire the drain
  **non-blocking**; the trainer reaps completions with ``poll`` and cuts the tail with ``abort``.
- ``poll()`` — the trajectories **completed since the last poll** (aggregated across workers).
- ``finalize_if_drained()`` — when a drive has naturally drained, join its worker refs and reap the
  final completions in one coordinator call before the next ``submit`` resets worker buffers.
- ``abort()`` — a **turn-boundary** stop: workers stop pulling and checkpoint their in-flight
  trajectories at the next turn boundary; returns the carried set (in-flight partials + not-started
  tasks). After it returns the inner engine is **decode-idle** → safe for the trainer to weight-sync.
- ``generate(request)`` — a thin *barrier* convenience (submit + drain-to-completion) kept for the
  colocate/``partial_rollout=false`` path, byte-identical to the pre-partial-rollout behaviour.

Two roles, one class:

- **Coordinator = rank 0** (``set_workers`` + ``submit``/``poll``/``abort``/``generate``,
  ``BROADCAST + RANK_ZERO``): rank 0 fans the batch into ``n × P`` single-trajectory tasks, fires one
  ``run_drain`` per worker (raw ``Worker.call``), serves ``next_task`` pulls, and aggregates the
  per-worker completed/carried buffers.
- **Worker = every instance** (``run_drain`` / ``_drain_worker`` / ``_run_one`` / ``_pull`` + the
  un-decorated control methods ``drain_completed``/``collect_carried``/``set_stopping``/
  ``reset_round``): ``run_drain`` blocks in its Worker-actor slot for the whole drive while the
  drain threads work; the control methods ride the threaded Worker
  (``worker_max_concurrency>1``) alongside it.

Weight sync: the trainer quiesces the rollout (``abort`` — turn-boundary checkpoint, or the
``generate`` barrier) and syncs *between* drives. The quiesce is structural: ``abort``/``generate``
join the drain threads (``ray.get(drain_refs)``), and every generate call runs on one of those
threads — after the join, nothing is in flight and the inner engine is decode-idle. Delegated
verbs below forward to the inner engine.
