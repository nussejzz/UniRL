"""The backend seam contract — the ``Backend`` protocol + the wire types.

Every ``sglang`` collaborator reaches the SGLang SRT runtime through this
protocol; the real implementations live beside it (``http.py`` — SRT server
subprocess + sync HTTP; ``native.py`` — in-process Engine). This module holds
no runtime code at all, so it is trivially CPU-importable.

**No RL types cross this seam.** ``generate`` takes ready-to-POST ``/generate``
payload dicts (one per prompt) and returns ``list[RawResult]`` (a structural view
of one parsed ``/generate`` candidate); the adapters do the
``Sample``↔wire translation. The impl absorbs its transport
asymmetries (thread fan-out, retries, SGLang's dict-vs-list response shape for
``n``) behind these signatures.

Deliberate divergences from the ``sglang_diffusion`` seam:

- No ``target_modules`` on the update verbs — the diffusion-side default
  ``["transformer"]`` doesn't match LLM module naming; omitting the field lets
  the SRT server accept all incoming weights correctly.
- No ``weights_checksum`` — the checksum/verify path is vLLM-Omni-only.
- ``flush_cache`` is a first-class verb so the engine can orchestrate
  flush-before-sleep as a visible line.
