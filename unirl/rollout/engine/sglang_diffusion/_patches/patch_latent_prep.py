"""Driver-authoritative ``initial_noise`` batch expansion + packed-latents
parity for the provided-latents branch (gap #3 / packed-model gap, LIN-365).

UniRL's NoiseRecipe (#208) makes x_T driver-authoritative; the engine
ships it as ``batch.latents`` (via ``patch_sampling_io`` -> ``Req.latents``).
Stock upstream ``LatentPreparationStage.forward`` handles provided latents with
just ``latents = latents.to(device)`` -- it does NOT (a) expand a ``[1, ...]``
or ``[num_prompts, ...]`` tensor to the per-sample ``[batch_size, ...]``, NOR
(b) run the packing / latent-ids prep that the randn branch performs via
``pipeline_config.maybe_pack_latents`` and ``maybe_prepare_latent_ids``.

The fork did both. Without (a), a group-shared or single-seed initial noise
crashes or mis-shapes the rollout. Without (b), packed models (FLUX.2-Klein /
M3) leave ``batch.latent_ids = None``, and ``DenoisingStage._prepare_denoising_loop
-> Flux2PipelineConfig.prepare_pos_cond_kwargs -> get_freqs_cis`` then dies on
``batch.latent_ids.ndim`` (AttributeError: NoneType). The randn branch in
upstream does exactly the right thing: order is
``maybe_prepare_latent_ids(unpacked) -> set batch.latent_ids -> maybe_pack_latents``,
and we mirror that here for the provided-latents path.

This REPLACES ``forward``'s provided-latents branch and delegates the
``latents is None`` (randn) branch back to upstream's ``forward``. Pure SD3
remains a no-op because SD3's ``maybe_prepare_latent_ids`` returns ``None`` and
``maybe_pack_latents`` returns the latents unchanged. The grouped path
(``run_grouped_requests``) already delegates to ``forward`` per-batch whenever
any ``batch.latents is not None``, so wrapping ``forward`` alone covers
rollout-with-initial_noise on both the single and grouped paths.
