"""Turn abrupt driver termination into an orderly teardown.

A training driver that dies on an unhandled ``SIGTERM`` never runs its
``finally`` blocks, so the rollout engine's subprocess tree is never asked to
shut down. On the anchored vLLM-Omni topology that stranded four ``Worker_TP``
processes holding ~7.3 GiB of device memory each until they were reaped by
hand.

The engine-side fate-sharing watchdog
(:func:`unirl.rollout.engine.vllm_omni.patches.runtime.install_fate_sharing`)
is the hard backstop for that. This module is the *graceful* half: it gives the
driver a chance to shut the engine down properly — releasing KV cache, letting
Ray actors exit cleanly, flushing loggers — instead of relying on the tree
being force-killed.

Three guarantees, in order of preference:

1. A termination signal unwinds the main thread through the existing
   ``finally`` blocks, so teardown runs the way it does on a clean exit.
2. Teardown runs at most once, whichever path reaches it (normal return,
   exception, signal, or ``atexit``).
3. The process exits even if teardown wedges — a hard deadline and a
   second-signal escape hatch both bypass Python entirely.
